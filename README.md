# PathBench-MIL: A comprehensive, flexible Benchmarking/AutoML framework for multiple instance learning in pathology.

PATHBENCH IS CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT, SOME FEATURES MAY NOT WORK AS INTENDED

PathBench is a Python package designed to facilitate benchmarking, experimentation, and optimization of Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) for computational histopathology. It provides tools for conducting experiments, evaluating performance, visualizing results, and optimizing hyperparameters. PathBench is built on top of the excellent [SlideFlow](https://github.com/jamesdolezal/slideflow) package for handling Whole Slide images and integrates Optuna for hyperparameter optimization. PathBench is useful for researchers aiming to benchmarking different pipeline parameters / models for use in their subdomain (in which case the benchmark mode is more suitable) and users starting a Computational Pathology project and wanting to find a suitable pipeline architecture (in which case the optimization mode is more suitable).

PathBench operates in two modes: Benchmark-mode and Optimization-mode. Benchmark mode takes in different options for the computational pipeline (e.g. normalization methods, feature extractors) and benchmarks all possible combinations, outputting a performance table sorted on mode performance. Optimization mode simply aims to find the optimal set of computational pipeline hyperparameters to optimize a set performance objective, it will not test all possible combinations.

One can use PathBench for binary classification, multiclass classification, regression and continuous/discrete survival prediction problems. Multiple datasets can be integrated into a single experiment to allowing for training or testing on different data sources. All user parameters are captured in a single .yaml file.

The output of benchmarking experiments can be loaded into a plotly-based visualization app for further investigation. We also provide a pipeline which calculates the semantic feature similarity between feature bags which can then be used to build model ensembles.

PathBench is being developed at the Leiden University Medical Center: Department of Pathology.

# Running PathBench with Docker (GPU Support)

This guide explains how to build and run the PathBench-MIL repository using Docker with GPU support. It also shows how to modify the configuration file (`conf.yaml`) interactively.

## Prerequisites

- **Docker** installed
- **NVIDIA Drivers** and [nvidia-container-toolkit](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-container-toolkit) installed (for GPU support)

## Building the Docker Image
Navigate to the root of your repository (where the Dockerfile is located).

Build the Docker image by running:

```bash
docker build -t pathbench-gpu .
```
### Running the Container Interactively
To modify the configuration file (conf.yaml) without rebuilding the image, you can run the container interactively and mount your custom config.

### Option A: Mount a Custom Config File
If you have a custom conf.yaml on your host (for example, located at /path/to/custom/conf.yaml), run:

```bash

docker run --gpus all -it --rm \
  -v /path/to/custom/conf.yaml:/app/PathBench-MIL/conf.yaml \
  pathbench-gpu bash
```
This command does the following:

- --gpus all: Enables GPU support.
- -it: Runs the container interactively.
- --rm: Automatically removes the container when it exits.
- -v /path/to/custom/conf.yaml:/app/PathBench-MIL/conf.yaml: Mounts your local conf.yaml to override the one inside the container.
- bash: Opens a bash shell in the container.

### Option B: Mount the Entire Directory
If you want the flexibility to modify any files in /app/PathBench-MIL, mount the whole directory:

```bash
docker run --gpus all -it --rm \
  -v /path/to/local/PathBench-MIL:/app/PathBench-MIL \
  pathbench-gpu bash
```
## Modifying the Config and Running PathBench
Once inside the container's bash shell, you can:

Edit the configuration file using an editor (e.g., nano or vim):

```bash
nano conf.yaml
```
Note: If an editor like nano is not installed, you can install it by running:

```bash
apt-get update && apt-get install -y nano
```
Run PathBench by executing:

```bash
bash run_pathbench.sh
```
This script will:

- Check for the virtual environment (already set up during build).
- Source it and set the slideflow backend environment variables.
- Execute main.py with your configuration file.
## Docker TDLR:
1) Build the image with docker build -t pathbench-gpu .
2) Run interactively with GPU support and mount your custom config:
- Option A: Mount just the config file.
- Option B: Mount the entire /app/PathBench-MIL directory.
3) Edit and run the application within the container shell.

```

# Setting up a Project
PathBench inherits the project functionality from SlideFlow. PathBench allows creating projects through the configuration file. In the configuration, project-specific settings can be specified in the `experiment` section. The `experiment` section also saves several other important settings:

### Project-related settings:

- `project_name`: The name of the project.
- `annotation_file`: The path to the annotation file.


### Training-related settings:

- `balancing`: The balancing technique to be used. This can be `tile`, `slide`, `patient`, or `category`. Balancing is used to construct training batches with a balanced distribution of classes/patients/slides/tiles.
- `split_technique`: The split technique to be used. This can be `k-fold` or `fixed`.
- `k`: The number of folds for k-fold cross-validation.
- `val_fraction`: The fraction of the training data to be used for validation.
- `best_epoch_based_on` : measure to base the epoch selection for selecting the optimal model state on. Can be 'val_loss', any of the task default metrics (roc_auc_score, c_index, r2_score), or any of the custom metrics defined.
- `epochs`: The number of epochs for training.
- `batch_size`: The batch size for training.
- `bag_size`: The bag size for MIL models.
- `aggregation_level`: The aggregation level can be `slide` or `patient`. This specifies at which levels bags are aggregated, effectively creating slide-level or patient-level predictions.
- `encoder_layers` : The number of layers used for the encoder in the MIL aggregator
- `z_dim` : The dimensionality of the latent space in the MIL encoder.
- `dropout_p` : The dropout probability in the MIL model.
- `class_weighting`: Whether to weight the instances for each class during training based on occurence.
  
### General settings:

- `task`: The task can be `classification`, `regression`, or `survival`.
- `mode`: The mode can be either `benchmark` or `optimization`.
- `num_workers` : Number of workers for parallelization, set to 0 to disable parallel processing.
- `custom_metrics` : List of custom metrics to be used, which should be defined in metrics.py or as a fastai-metric: https://docs.fast.ai/metrics.html
- `report` : Whether to output a slide processing report (see Slideflow documentation)
- `mixed_precision` : Whether to extract features in mixed precision (fp16) mode, reducing GPU requirements.


# Datasets
The datasets to be used in the project can be specified in the datasets section. One can add any arbitrary number of data sources to a project and specify whether these should be used for training/validation or as testing datasets:
```yaml
datasets:  # List of datasets to be used
  - name: dataset1  # Name of the dataset
    slide_path: path/to/your/slides  # Path to the slide data
    tfrecord_path: path/to/save/tfrecords  # Path to save tfrecords
    tile_path: path/to/save/tiles  # Path to save tiles
    used_for: training  # Whether the dataset is used for training or testing

  - name: dataset2
    slide_path: path/to/your/other/slides
    tfrecord_path: path/to/other/tfrecords
    tile_path: path/to/other/tiles
    used_for: testing
```

# Annotations
The annotation file should be a CSV file with the following columns:

- slide: The name/identifier of the slide, **without the file extension (e.g. .svs, .tiff)**.
- patient: The name/identifier of the patient to which the slide corresponds.
- dataset: The name of the dataset to which the slide belongs.
For classification tasks, the annotation file should also contain a column with the target labels. This column should be named category. For regression tasks, the annotation file should contain a column with the target values. This column should be named value. For survival tasks, the annotation file should contain columns with the survival time and event status. These columns should be named time and event, respectively.

Example of a valid annotation file for a classification task, assuming we use two datasets: dataset1 and dataset2:
```csv
slide,patient,dataset,category
slide1,patient1,dataset1,0
slide2,patient1,dataset1,1
slide3,patient2,dataset1,0
slide4,patient2,dataset1,1
slide5,patient3,dataset1,0
slide6,patient3,dataset1,1
slide7,patient4,dataset2,0
slide8,patient4,dataset2,1
slide9,patient5,dataset2,0
slide10,patient5,dataset2,1
```

For a regression task:
```csv
slide,patient,dataset,value
slide1,patient1,dataset1,0.1
slide2,patient1,dataset1,0.2
slide3,patient2,dataset1,0.3
slide4,patient2,dataset1,0.4
slide5,patient3,dataset1,0.5
slide6,patient3,dataset1,0.6
slide7,patient4,dataset2,0.7
slide8,patient4,dataset2,0.8
slide9,patient5,dataset2,0.9
slide10,patient5,dataset2,1.0
```

For a continuous survival task, where time is a number of days/weeks/months/years and event expects 1 for patient which are dead (event occured) and 0 for those that are alive (event not occured).:
```csv
slide,patient,dataset,time,event
slide1,patient1,dataset1,26,1
slide2,patient1,dataset1,15,1
slide3,patient2,dataset1,16,1
slide4,patient2,dataset1,42,0
slide5,patient3,dataset1,13,1
slide6,patient3,dataset1,11,1
slide7,patient4,dataset2,6,0
slide8,patient4,dataset2,5,1
slide9,patient5,dataset2,84,1
slide10,patient5,dataset2,43,1
```

For a discrete survival task, we bin the time column into bins (e.g. quantiles):
```csv
slide,patient,dataset,time,event
slide1,patient1,dataset1,3,1
slide2,patient1,dataset1,2,1
slide3,patient2,dataset1,2,1
slide4,patient2,dataset1,3,0
slide5,patient3,dataset1,2,1
slide6,patient3,dataset1,2,1
slide7,patient4,dataset2,1,0
slide8,patient4,dataset2,1,1
slide9,patient5,dataset2,1,1
slide10,patient5,dataset2,3,1
```
# Running PathBench

## Normalization
PathBench currently supports:
- Macenko
- Reinhard
- CycleGan

normalization.
## Feature Extractors
PathBench supports a wide range of different feature extractors, including SOTA foundation models for pathology. Most of these models are automatically downloaded by PathBench, however, some models require a huggingface account key to access the model (labeled 'Gated' in the feature extraction table) or require manually downloading the model weights (labeled 'Manual' in the extraction table). For each of the models, a link to the publication is given, and for the manual/gated models, the link for downloading the models or gaining model access are also provided.

## MIL aggregators
In addition to a wide range of feature extractors, PathBench also includes a wide variety of MIL aggregation methods. Most of these support all tasks (Binary classification, Muliclass classifcation, regression and survival prediction), but some like the CLAM-models only support binary classification. We are actively working on extending support for these models.

## Extending PathBench
PathBench is designed such that it easy to add new feature extractors and MIL aggregation models. 
1. **Custom Feature Extractors**
New feature extractors are added to pathbench/models/feature_extractors.py and follow this format:
```python
@register_torch
class kaiko_s8(TorchFeatureExtractor):
    """
    Kaiko S8 feature extractor, with small Vision Transformer backbone

    Parameters
    ----------
    tile_px : int
        The size of the tile

    Attributes
    ----------
    model : VisionTransformer
        The Vision Transformer model
    transform : torchvision.transforms.Compose
        The transformation pipeline
    preprocess_kwargs : dict
        The preprocessing arguments

    Methods
    -------
    dump_config()
        Dump the configuration of the feature extractor
    """
    tag = 'kaiko_s8'

    def __init__(self, tile_px=256, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)

        self.model = torch.hub.load("kaiko-ai/towards_large_pathology_fms", 'vits8', trust_repo=True)

        self.model.to('cuda')
        self.num_features = 384
        self.transform = transforms.Compose(
            [
                transforms.Resize(224),
                # Transform to float tensor
                transforms.ConvertImageDtype(torch.float32),
                transforms.Normalize(mean=(0.5, 0.5, 0.5), std=(0.5, 0.5, 0.5)),
            ]
        )
        self.model.eval()
        # Slideflow standardization
        self.preprocess_kwargs = {'standardize': False}

    def dump_config(self):
        return {
            'class': 'kaiko_s8',
            'kwargs': {}
        }
```
Feature extractor models require a @register_torch descriptor to be recognizable by PathBench as a specifiable feature extractor. Furthermore, the class requires a model to be specified, the embedding size to be specified and a transformation pipeline. For more information, please see the [slideflow documentation](https://slideflow.dev/).
2. **Custom MIL aggregators**
Adding MIL aggregation methods is done similarly, but in the pathbench/models/aggregators.py script:
```python
class lse_mil(nn.Module):
    """
    Multiple instance learning model with log-sum-exp pooling.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_feats : int
        Number of input features
    n_out : int
        Number of output classes
    z_dim : int
        Dimensionality of the hidden layer
    dropout_p : float
        Dropout probability
    r : float
        scaling factor for log-sum-exp pooling
    activation_function : str
        activation function to use (as present in pytorch), given as a string
    encoder_layers: int
        number of encoder layers to use.
    goal: str
        overall goal of the model (classification, regression, survival, survival_discrete), used to account for different output requirements.
    
    Attributes
    ----------
    encoder : nn.Sequential
        Encoder network
    head : nn.Sequential
        Prediction head network
    r : float
        scaling factor for log-sum-exp pooling

    Methods
    -------
    forward(bags)
        Forward pass through the model
    
    """

def __init__(self,
                 n_feats: int,
                 n_out: int,
                 z_dim: int = 256,
                 dropout_p: float = 0.1,
                 r: float = 1.0,
                 activation_function='ReLU',
                 encoder_layers=1,
                 goal='classification'):
        super().__init__()
        use_bn = (goal == 'classification')
        self.encoder = build_encoder(n_feats, z_dim, encoder_layers,
                                     activation_function, dropout_p, use_bn)

        if goal == 'classification':
            self.head = nn.Sequential(
                nn.Flatten(),
                nn.BatchNorm1d(z_dim),
                nn.Dropout(dropout_p),
                nn.Linear(z_dim, n_out)
            )
        #Continuous survival or regression models should output a single value
        elif goal in ['survival', 'regression']:
            self.head = nn.Linear(z_dim, 1)
        #Discrete survival models should output a distribution over time bins
        elif goal == 'survival_discrete':
            self.head = nn.Linear(z_dim, n_out)
        else:
            raise ValueError(f"Unsupported goal: {goal}")

        self.r = r
        self.goal = goal
        self._initialize_weights()

    def _initialize_weights(self):
        initialize_weights(self)

    def forward(self, bags):
        batch_size, n_patches, n_feats = bags.shape
        embeddings = self.encoder(bags.view(-1, n_feats))
        embeddings = embeddings.view(batch_size, n_patches, -1)
        # LSE pooling
        lse_pooling = self.r * torch.logsumexp(embeddings / self.r, dim=1)
        scores = self.head(lse_pooling)
        return scores

```
The MIL aggregation function should take the bags in its forward function and output the prediction scores. Typically, this involves an encoder network and a prediction head. If the aggregation method supports attention values, one can add an additional method:
```python
    def calculate_attention(self, bags, lens, apply_softmax=None):
        embeddings = self.encoder(bags)
        attention_scores = self.attention(embeddings)
        if apply_softmax:
            attention_scores = F.softmax(attention_scores, dim=1)
        return attention_scores
```
Which calculates attention for the input bags. This can then be used to generate attention heatmaps.
3. **Custom Losses**
Custom losses can be added to pathbench/utils/losses.py and need to be specified in the configuration file under custom_loss to be active during benchmarking. As some loss functions rely on attention values to be calculated, one has to specify whether the loss function requires attention, and if so, give it as a parameter to the forward function (attention_weights). Note that PathBench will use the default task loss when an attention-specific loss is specified but the current MIL method does not use/support attention values. An example:
```python
class AttentionEntropyMinimizedCrossEntropyLoss(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, entropy_lambda: float = 1.0, weight: Optional[Tensor] = None):
        """
        Args:
            entropy_lambda (float): Regularization strength for the entropy minimization.
            weight (Tensor, optional): A manual rescaling weight given to each class. If given, has to be a Tensor of size `C`.
        """
        super().__init__()
        self.require_attention = True
        self.entropy_lambda = entropy_lambda
        self.cross_entropy = nn.CrossEntropyLoss(weight=weight)

    def forward(self, preds: Tensor, targets: Tensor, attention_weights: Tensor) -> Tensor:
        # Standard cross-entropy loss
        ce_loss = self.cross_entropy(preds, targets)

        # Check if attention weights are normalized
        if attention_weights.dim() > 1:
            attention_weights = torch.softmax(attention_weights, dim=-1)

        # Entropy minimization term
        entropy = -torch.sum(attention_weights * torch.log(attention_weights + 1e-9), dim=1)
        entropy_min_reg = torch.mean(entropy)
        
        # Total loss
        loss = ce_loss + self.entropy_lambda * entropy_min_reg
        return loss
```
4.   **Custom Augmentations**
Custom augmentations are added to augmentations.py and expect the input to be bags of shape (tiles, features). An example:
```python

def patch_mixing(bag: torch.Tensor, mixing_rate: float = 0.5) -> torch.Tensor:
    """
    Randomly selects and mixes two instances within the same bag based on a given mixing rate.

    Parameters:
    bag (torch.Tensor): A 2D tensor of shape (num_instances, num_features) representing a bag of instances.
    mixing_rate (float): The probability of selecting features from one instance over another during mixing.

    Returns:
    torch.Tensor: A new bag where one instance is replaced by a mix of two randomly selected instances.
    """
    indices = torch.randperm(bag.size(0))[:2]
    instance1, instance2 = bag[indices]
    mask = torch.from_numpy(np.random.binomial(1, mixing_rate, size=instance1.shape)).bool()
    mixed_instance = torch.where(mask, instance1, instance2)
    bag[indices[0]] = mixed_instance
    return bag
```
6.   **Custom Training Metrics**
Similarly, one can add custom training metrics which will be measured during training. The metrics needs to inheret from fastai's Metric class and have the methods as given down below:
```python
class ConcordanceIndex(Metric):
    """
    Concordance index metric for survival analysis, supporting both:
      (1) Continuous survival predictions: preds.shape == (batch_size,)
      (2) Discrete survival predictions:   preds.shape == (batch_size, n_bins)
          We automatically convert discrete to continuous by a weighted sum
          over the bin indices [1..n_bins].
    """

    def __init__(self):
        self._name = "concordance_index"
        self.reset()

    def reset(self):
        """Reset the metric."""
        self.preds = []
        self.durations = []
        self.events = []

    def accumulate(self, learn):
        """Accumulate predictions and targets from a batch."""
        preds = learn.pred
        targets = learn.y
        self.accum_values(preds, targets)

    def accum_values(self, preds, targets):
        """
        Accumulate predictions and targets from a batch.

        - targets must be shape (batch_size, 2) -> [duration, event].
        - preds can be (batch_size,) for continuous survival
          or (batch_size, n_bins) for discrete survival.

        We automatically interpret 2D preds as discrete probabilities
        and convert them to a single predicted time by a weighted sum
        with bin indices [1..n_bins].
        """
        preds, targets = to_detach(preds), to_detach(targets)

        # Flatten or convert any containers into a single tensor
        preds = self._flatten_preds(preds)

        # durations = targets[:, 0], events = targets[:, 1]
        durations = targets[:, 0].float()
        events = targets[:, 1].float()

        # If we have discrete predictions, convert to continuous
        if preds.dim() > 1 and preds.shape[1] > 1:
            #Check if preds are probabilities
            if not torch.all(preds.sum(dim=1) == 1.0):
                preds = torch.softmax(preds, dim=-1)
            #Perform weighted sum over bins
            preds = (preds * torch.arange(1, preds.shape[1] + 1).float()).sum(dim=1)


        #Check if preds should be 

        # Accumulate for final c-index computation
        self.preds.append(preds)
        self.durations.append(durations)
        self.events.append(events)

    def _flatten_preds(self, preds):
        """
        Flattens nested structures of predictions, if needed.
        E.g. if preds is a tuple/list, or has multiple dimensions.
        """
        # For your use case, you might just do: return preds.view(-1, *preds.shape[2:])
        # But here's a robust fallback:
        if isinstance(preds, (list, tuple)):
            # Attempt to concatenate or flatten
            preds = torch.cat([p.view(-1, *p.shape[2:]) if p.dim() > 1 else p.flatten()
                               for p in preds], dim=0)
        return preds

    @property
    def value(self):
        """Calculate the concordance index using lifelines."""
        if len(self.preds) == 0:
            return None

        # Concatenate all predictions/durations/events across mini-batches
        preds = torch.cat(self.preds).cpu().numpy()
        durations = torch.cat(self.durations).cpu().numpy()
        events = torch.cat(self.events).cpu().numpy()

    def name(self):
        return self._name

```
## Futher extension
For more fundamental changes, and adding new normalization methods, one needs to change the underlying slideflow code. PathBench uses a [forked version](https://github.com/Sbrussee/slideflow_fork) of the slideflow code, which is added as a submodule in PathBench's repository.

## Developing PathBench
PathBench is currently in its early development stages, but we welcome collaboration on the development of PathBench. Please use pull requests to add new features or open issues if you encounter bugs or would like to see certain features. When encountering bugs, please provide your pathbench configuration along with information on your python environment and OS, this aids in solving the problem in a correct and timely manner.
