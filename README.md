# PathBench-MIL: A comprehensive, flexible Benchmarking/AutoML framework for multiple instance learning in pathology.

PATHBENCH IS CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT, SOME FEATURES MAY NOT WORK AS INTENDED

PathBench is a Python package designed to facilitate benchmarking, experimentation, and optimization of Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) for computational histopathology. It provides tools for conducting experiments, evaluating performance, visualizing results, and optimizing hyperparameters. PathBench is built on top of the excellent [SlideFlow](https://github.com/jamesdolezal/slideflow) package for handling Whole Slide images and integrates Optuna for hyperparameter optimization. PathBench is useful for researchers aiming to benchmarking different pipeline parameters / models for use in their subdomain (in which case the benchmark mode is more suitable) and users starting a Computational Pathology project and wanting to find a suitable pipeline architecture (in which case the optimization mode is more suitable).

PathBench operates in two modes: Benchmark-mode and Optimization-mode. Benchmark mode takes in different options for the computational pipeline (e.g. normalization methods, feature extractors) and benchmarks all possible combinations, outputting a performance table sorted on mode performance. Optimization mode simply aims to find the optimal set of computational pipeline hyperparameters to optimize a set performance objective, it will not test all possible combinations.

One can use PathBench for binary classification, multiclass classification, regression and continuous/discrete survival prediction problems. Multiple datasets can be integrated into a single experiment to allowing for training or testing on different data sources. All user parameters are captured in a single .yaml file.

The output of benchmarking experiments can be loaded into a plotly-based visualization app for further investigation. We also provide a pipeline which calculates the semantic feature similarity between feature bags which can then be used to build model ensembles.

PathBench is being developed at the Leiden University Medical Center: Department of Pathology.

# Setting up a Project
PathBench inherits the project functionality from SlideFlow. PathBench allows creating projects through the configuration file. In the configuration, project-specific settings can be specified in the `experiment` section. The `experiment` section also saves several other important settings:

### Project-related settings:

- `project_name`: The name of the project.
- `annotation_file`: The path to the annotation file.


### Training-related settings:

- `balancing`: The balancing technique to be used. This can be `tile`, `slide`, `patient`, or `category`. Balancing is used to construct training batches with a balanced distribution of classes/patients/slides/tiles.
- `split_technique`: The split technique to be used. This can be `k-fold` or `fixed`.
- `k`: The number of folds for k-fold cross-validation.
- `val_fraction`: The fraction of the training data to be used for validation.
- `best_epoch_based_on` : measure to base the epoch selection for selecting the optimal model state on. Can be 'val_loss', any of the task default metrics (roc_auc_score, c_index, r2_score), or any of the custom metrics defined.
- `epochs`: The number of epochs for training.
- `batch_size`: The batch size for training.
- `bag_size`: The bag size for MIL models.
- `aggregation_level`: The aggregation level can be `slide` or `patient`. This specifies at which levels bags are aggregated, effectively creating slide-level or patient-level predictions.
- `encoder_layers` : The number of layers used for the encoder in the MIL aggregator
- `z_dim` : The dimensionality of the latent space in the MIL encoder.
- `dropout_p` : The dropout probability in the MIL model.
- `class_weighting`: Whether to weight the instances for each class during training based on occurence.
  
### General settings:

- `task`: The task can be `classification`, `regression`, `survival` or 'survival_discrete'.
- `mode`: The mode can be either `benchmark` or `optimization`.
- `num_workers` : Number of workers for parallelization, set to 0 to disable parallel processing.
- `custom_metrics` : List of custom metrics to be used, which should be defined in metrics.py or as a fastai-metric: https://docs.fast.ai/metrics.html
- `report` : Whether to output a slide processing report (see Slideflow documentation). Reports will be saved in the tfrecords directory of the corresponding tiles in PDF format.
- `mixed_precision` : Whether to extract features in mixed precision (fp16) mode, reducing GPU requirements.
- `skip_extracted` : Whether to force re-extraction of tiles from WSIs, even if already available. If set to True, will skip re-extraction if tiles are available.
- `skip_feature_extraction`: Whether to force re-extraction of features from tfrecord tiles. If set to True, will skip re-extraction if features are available.
- `save_tiles`: Whether to save .jpg images of each tile in addition to the .tfrecord formatted tiles.

# Datasets
The datasets to be used in the project can be specified in the datasets section. One can add any arbitrary number of data sources to a project and specify whether these should be used for training/validation or as testing datasets:
```yaml
datasets:  # List of datasets to be used
  - name: dataset1  # Name of the dataset
    slide_path: path/to/your/slides  # Path to the slide data
    tfrecord_path: path/to/save/tfrecords  # Path to save tfrecords
    tile_path: path/to/save/tiles  # Path to save tiles
    used_for: training  # Whether the dataset is used for training or testing

  - name: dataset2
    slide_path: path/to/your/other/slides
    tfrecord_path: path/to/other/tfrecords
    tile_path: path/to/other/tiles
    used_for: testing
```

# Annotations
The annotation file should be a CSV file with the following columns:

- slide: The name/identifier of the slide, **without the file extension (e.g. .svs, .tiff)**.
- patient: The name/identifier of the patient to which the slide corresponds.
- dataset: The name of the dataset to which the slide belongs.
For classification tasks, the annotation file should also contain a column with the target labels. This column should be named category. For regression tasks, the annotation file should contain a column with the target values. This column should be named value. For survival tasks, the annotation file should contain columns with the survival time and event status. These columns should be named time and event, respectively.

Example of a valid annotation file for a classification task, assuming we use two datasets: dataset1 and dataset2:
```csv
slide,patient,dataset,category
slide1,patient1,dataset1,0
slide2,patient1,dataset1,1
slide3,patient2,dataset1,0
slide4,patient2,dataset1,1
slide5,patient3,dataset1,0
slide6,patient3,dataset1,1
slide7,patient4,dataset2,0
slide8,patient4,dataset2,1
slide9,patient5,dataset2,0
slide10,patient5,dataset2,1
```

For a regression task:
```csv
slide,patient,dataset,value
slide1,patient1,dataset1,0.1
slide2,patient1,dataset1,0.2
slide3,patient2,dataset1,0.3
slide4,patient2,dataset1,0.4
slide5,patient3,dataset1,0.5
slide6,patient3,dataset1,0.6
slide7,patient4,dataset2,0.7
slide8,patient4,dataset2,0.8
slide9,patient5,dataset2,0.9
slide10,patient5,dataset2,1.0
```

For a continuous survival task, where time is a number of days/weeks/months/years and event expects 1 for patient which are dead (event occured) and 0 for those that are alive (event not occured).:
```csv
slide,patient,dataset,time,event
slide1,patient1,dataset1,26,1
slide2,patient1,dataset1,15,1
slide3,patient2,dataset1,16,1
slide4,patient2,dataset1,42,0
slide5,patient3,dataset1,13,1
slide6,patient3,dataset1,11,1
slide7,patient4,dataset2,6,0
slide8,patient4,dataset2,5,1
slide9,patient5,dataset2,84,1
slide10,patient5,dataset2,43,1
```

For a discrete survival task, we bin the time column into bins (e.g. quantiles):
```csv
slide,patient,dataset,time,event
slide1,patient1,dataset1,3,1
slide2,patient1,dataset1,2,1
slide3,patient2,dataset1,2,1
slide4,patient2,dataset1,3,0
slide5,patient3,dataset1,2,1
slide6,patient3,dataset1,2,1
slide7,patient4,dataset2,1,0
slide8,patient4,dataset2,1,1
slide9,patient5,dataset2,1,1
slide10,patient5,dataset2,3,1
```

```

Note that this script sets the configuration file as well as the name of the virtual environment, which can be changed:
```bash
#If virtual environment does not exist, construct one using pip
if [ ! -d "pathbench_env" ]; then
    python3 -m venv pathbench_env
    source pathbench_env/bin/activate
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt
else
    source pathbench_env/bin/activate
fi

## Normalization
PathBench currently supports:
- Macenko
- Reinhard
- CycleGan

normalization.
## Feature Extractors
PathBench supports a wide range of different feature extractors, including SOTA foundation models for pathology. Most of these models are automatically downloaded by PathBench, however, some models require a huggingface account key to access the model (labeled 'Gated' in the feature extraction table) or require manually downloading the model weights (labeled 'Manual' in the extraction table). For each of the models, a link to the publication is given, and for the manual/gated models, the link for downloading the models or gaining model access are also provided.

| Feature Extractor | Acquisition | Link |

## PathBench outputs
PathBench-MIL outputs a variety of visualizations and output tables with the performance metrics on the specified validation and testing datasets. Additionally, pathbench will automatically select the best performing model for each benchmarking/optimization experiment and save it for later use. Inference on this saved model can be performed using the utils/inference.py function, as explained below:

Make sure your model directory has the following structure (the critical file is mil_params.json):
```
experiments/{exp_name}/saved_models/best_test_model_{datetime}/
    â”œâ”€â”€ attention/
    â”œâ”€â”€ models/
    â”œâ”€â”€ history.csv
    â”œâ”€â”€ mil_params.json
    â”œâ”€â”€ predictions.parquet
    â””â”€â”€ slide_manifest.csv
```
It is also possible to use any of the models saved in experiments/{exp_name}/mil as inference input.

Run the Script:

For a single slide:
```bash
python utils/inference.py --model_dir /experiments/some_exp/saved_models/best_test_model_2023-05-27_12-34-56 --slide /path/to/slide.svs
```
For a directory of slides (with attention scores):
```bash
python utils/inference.py --model_dir /experiments/some_exp/saved_models/best_test_model_2023-05-27_12-34-56 --slide_dir /path/to/slides/ --attention
```

The script will save the predictions (and optionally attention values) for each slide:
- Predictions are saved as a .npy file (e.g., slide1_predictions.npy).
- If the --attention flag is used and attention scores are returned, they are saved as a separate .npy file (e.g., slide1_attention.npy).

## Interactive Visualization
PathBench-MIL provides an interactive plotly-dash application that can be used to investigate benchmarking/optimization results. 
By running:
```bash
python3 pathbench/visualization/vis_app.py --results /path/to/directory/with/results/
```
you can visualize PathBench's aggregated output files using the visualization application in your browser, which should look like this:

<p align="center">
  <img src="dashboard_screenshot.PNG" alt="Dashboard screenshot" width="700" height="400">
</p>

## Inference
PathBench-MIL allows you to run inference on new Whole Slide Images (WSIs) using any previously trained model stored under:
```experiments/{experiment_name}/mil```
Running inference will output:
- preds.npy: The prediction for the slide.
- attn.npy (optional): The attention scores if the MIL model supports attention.
- Slide heatmap (optional): A visual overlay of attention scores across the slide.
You can run inference for either a single slide or a directory of slides.
Example: Single Slide with Attention Heatmap
```
python3 pathbench/utils/inference.py \
    --slide path/to/slide.tiff \
    --model_dir experiments/exp1/mil/00217-256_128_macenko_h_optimus_0_1 \
    --cmap bwr \
    --heatmap \
    --config /path/to/conf.yaml
```
Example: Directory of Slides
```
python3 pathbench/utils/inference.py \
    --slide_dir /path/to/slides/ \
    --model_dir /path/to/experiment/mil/best_model/ \
    --config /path/to/conf.yaml \
    --heatmap
```
The script supports customizable heatmap visualization with options:
- --interpolation: e.g., bicubic, bilinear
- --cmap: Matplotlib colormap, e.g., inferno, bwr
- --norm: Use two_slope for diverging heatmaps centered at 0

The results are saved in the inference_results folder, including prediction vectors and heatmaps.

# Extending PathBench
PathBench is designed such that it easy to add new feature extractors and MIL aggregation models. 
1. **Custom Feature Extractors**
New feature extractors are added to pathbench/models/feature_extractors.py and follow this format:
```python
@register_torch
class kaiko_s8(TorchFeatureExtractor):
    """
    Kaiko S8 feature extractor, with small Vision Transformer backbone

    Parameters
    ----------
    tile_px : int
        The size of the tile

    Attributes
    ----------
    model : VisionTransformer
        The Vision Transformer model
    transform : torchvision.transforms.Compose
        The transformation pipeline
    preprocess_kwargs : dict
        The preprocessing arguments

    Methods
    -------
    dump_config()
        Dump the configuration of the feature extractor
    """
    tag = 'kaiko_s8'

    def __init__(self, tile_px=256, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)

        self.model = torch.hub.load("kaiko-ai/towards_large_pathology_fms", 'vits8', trust_repo=True)

        self.model.to('cuda')
        self.num_features = 384
        self.transform = transforms.Compose(
            [
                transforms.Resize(224),
                # Transform to float tensor
                transforms.ConvertImageDtype(torch.float32),
                transforms.Normalize(mean=(0.5, 0.5, 0.5), std=(0.5, 0.5, 0.5)),
            ]
        )
        self.model.eval()
        # Slideflow standardization
        self.preprocess_kwargs = {'standardize': False}

    def dump_config(self):
        return {
            'class': 'kaiko_s8',
            'kwargs': {}
        }
```
Feature extractor models require a @register_torch descriptor to be recognizable by PathBench as a specifiable feature extractor. Furthermore, the class requires a model to be specified, the embedding size to be specified and a transformation pipeline. For more information, please see the [slideflow documentation](https://slideflow.dev/).

### Slide-Level Feature Extractors
In addition to patch-level MIL pipelines, PathBench supports slide-level feature extractors, designed for encoding entire slides directly from tile embeddings and their coordinates.
To define a slide-level extractor, add 'slide' to its class name and inherit from SlideFeatureExtractor.
Example:
```
@register_torch
class titan_slide(SlideFeatureExtractor):
    tag = 'titan_slide'

    def __init__(self, tile_px: 256, **kwargs):
        ...
        self.build_encoders()
        self.tile_px = tile_px
        self.model = self.tile_encoder
        self.num_features = 768
        ...
```
Such extractors must implement a forward_slide method:
```
def forward_slide(self, tile_features, tile_coordinates, **kwargs):
    ...
    return slide_embedding
```
These do not use MIL aggregators. Instead, they require slide-level prediction heads, defined in slide_level_predictors.py. PathBench will automatically fall back to mlp_slide_classifier if a MIL aggregator is incorrectly paired with a slide-level extractor.
Slide-Level Head Model Example
```
class mlp_slide_classifier(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, n_feats, n_out, encoder_layers, z_dim, ...):
        ...
    def forward(self, x):
        latent = self.encoder(x)
        return self.head(latent)
```
2. **Custom MIL aggregators**
Adding MIL aggregation methods is done similarly, but in the pathbench/models/aggregators.py script:
```python
class lse_mil(nn.Module):
    """
    Multiple instance learning model with log-sum-exp pooling.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_feats : int
        Number of input features
    n_out : int
        Number of output classes
    z_dim : int
        Dimensionality of the hidden layer
    dropout_p : float
        Dropout probability
    r : float
        scaling factor for log-sum-exp pooling
    activation_function : str
        activation function to use (as present in pytorch), given as a string
    encoder_layers: int
        number of encoder layers to use.
    goal: str
        overall goal of the model (classification, regression, survival, survival_discrete), used to account for different output requirements.
    
    Attributes
    ----------
    encoder : nn.Sequential
        Encoder network
    head : nn.Sequential
        Prediction head network
    r : float
        scaling factor for log-sum-exp pooling

    Methods
    -------
    forward(bags)
        Forward pass through the model
    
    """

def __init__(self,
                 n_feats: int,
                 n_out: int,
                 z_dim: int = 256,
                 dropout_p: float = 0.1,
                 r: float = 1.0,
                 activation_function='ReLU',
                 encoder_layers=1,
                 goal='classification'):
        super().__init__()
        use_bn = (goal == 'classification')
        self.encoder = build_encoder(n_feats, z_dim, encoder_layers,
                                     activation_function, dropout_p, use_bn)

        if goal == 'classification':
            self.head = nn.Sequential(
                nn.Flatten(),
                nn.BatchNorm1d(z_dim),
                nn.Dropout(dropout_p),
                nn.Linear(z_dim, n_out)
            )
        #Continuous survival or regression models should output a single value
        elif goal in ['survival', 'regression']:
            self.head = nn.Linear(z_dim, 1)
        #Discrete survival models should output a distribution over time bins
        elif goal == 'survival_discrete':
            self.head = nn.Linear(z_dim, n_out)
        else:
            raise ValueError(f"Unsupported goal: {goal}")

        self.r = r
        self.goal = goal
        self._initialize_weights()

    def _initialize_weights(self):
        initialize_weights(self)

    def forward(self, bags):
        batch_size, n_patches, n_feats = bags.shape
        embeddings = self.encoder(bags.view(-1, n_feats))
        embeddings = embeddings.view(batch_size, n_patches, -1)
        # LSE pooling
        lse_pooling = self.r * torch.logsumexp(embeddings / self.r, dim=1)
        scores = self.head(lse_pooling)
        return scores

```
The MIL aggregation function should take the bags in its forward function and output the prediction scores. Typically, this involves an encoder network and a prediction head. If the aggregation method supports attention values, one can add an additional method:
```python
    def calculate_attention(self, bags, lens, apply_softmax=None):
        embeddings = self.encoder(bags)
        attention_scores = self.attention(embeddings)
        if apply_softmax:
            attention_scores = F.softmax(attention_scores, dim=1)
        return attention_scores
```
Which calculates attention for the input bags. This can then be used to generate attention heatmaps.
3. **Custom Losses**
Custom losses can be added to pathbench/utils/losses.py and need to be specified in the configuration file under custom_loss to be active during benchmarking. As some loss functions rely on attention values to be calculated, one has to specify whether the loss function requires attention, and if so, give it as a parameter to the forward function (attention_weights). Note that PathBench will use the default task loss when an attention-specific loss is specified but the current MIL method does not use/support attention values. An example:
```python
class AttentionEntropyMinimizedCrossEntropyLoss(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, entropy_lambda: float = 1.0, weight: Optional[Tensor] = None):
        """
        Args:
            entropy_lambda (float): Regularization strength for the entropy minimization.
            weight (Tensor, optional): A manual rescaling weight given to each class. If given, has to be a Tensor of size `C`.
        """
        super().__init__()
        self.require_attention = True
        self.entropy_lambda = entropy_lambda
        self.cross_entropy = nn.CrossEntropyLoss(weight=weight)

    def forward(self, preds: Tensor, targets: Tensor, attention_weights: Tensor) -> Tensor:
        # Standard cross-entropy loss
        ce_loss = self.cross_entropy(preds, targets)

        # Check if attention weights are normalized
        if attention_weights.dim() > 1:
            attention_weights = torch.softmax(attention_weights, dim=-1)

        # Entropy minimization term
        entropy = -torch.sum(attention_weights * torch.log(attention_weights + 1e-9), dim=1)
        entropy_min_reg = torch.mean(entropy)
        
        # Total loss
        loss = ce_loss + self.entropy_lambda * entropy_min_reg
        return loss
```

5.   **Custom Training Metrics**
Similarly, one can add custom training metrics which will be measured during training. The metrics needs to inheret from fastai's Metric class and have the methods as given down below:
```python
class ConcordanceIndex(Metric):
    """
    Concordance index metric for survival analysis, supporting both:
      (1) Continuous survival predictions: preds.shape == (batch_size,)
      (2) Discrete survival predictions:   preds.shape == (batch_size, n_bins)
          We automatically convert discrete to continuous by a weighted sum
          over the bin indices [1..n_bins].
    """

    def __init__(self):
        self._name = "concordance_index"
        self.reset()

    def reset(self):
        """Reset the metric."""
        self.preds = []
        self.durations = []
        self.events = []

    def accumulate(self, learn):
        """Accumulate predictions and targets from a batch."""
        preds = learn.pred
        targets = learn.y
        self.accum_values(preds, targets)

    def accum_values(self, preds, targets):
        """
        Accumulate predictions and targets from a batch.

        - targets must be shape (batch_size, 2) -> [duration, event].
        - preds can be (batch_size,) for continuous survival
          or (batch_size, n_bins) for discrete survival.

        We automatically interpret 2D preds as discrete probabilities
        and convert them to a single predicted time by a weighted sum

        """
        preds, targets = to_detach(preds), to_detach(targets)

        # Flatten or convert any containers into a single tensor
        preds = self._flatten_preds(preds)

        # durations = targets[:, 0], events = targets[:, 1]
        durations = targets[:, 0].float()
        events = targets[:, 1].float()

        # If we have discrete predictions, convert to continuous
        if preds.dim() > 1 and preds.shape[1] > 1:
            #Check if preds are probabilities
            if not torch.all(preds.sum(dim=1) == 1.0):
                preds = torch.softmax(preds, dim=-1)
            #Perform weighted sum over bins
            preds = (preds * torch.arange(1, preds.shape[1] + 1).float()).sum(dim=1)


        #Check if preds should be 

        # Accumulate for final c-index computation
        self.preds.append(preds)
        self.durations.append(durations)
        self.events.append(events)

    def _flatten_preds(self, preds):
        """

        # But here's a robust fallback:

            # Attempt to concatenate or flatten
            preds = torch.cat([p.view(-1, *p.shape[2:]) if p.dim() > 1 else p.flatten()
                               for p in preds], dim=0)
        return preds

    @property
    def value(self):
        """Calculate the concordance index using lifelines."""
        if len(self.preds) == 0:
            return None

        # Concatenate all predictions/durations/events across mini-batches
        preds = torch.cat(self.preds).cpu().numpy()
        durations = torch.cat(self.durations).cpu().numpy()

    @property
    def name(self):
        return self._name

```
## Futher extension
For more fundamental changes, and adding new normalization methods, one needs to change the underlying slideflow code. PathBench uses a [forked version](https://github.com/Sbrussee/slideflow_fork) of the slideflow code, which is added as a submodule in PathBench's repository.
