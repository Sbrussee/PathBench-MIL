MIL Aggregators
===============

In addition to a wide range of feature extractors, PathBench also includes a wide variety of MIL aggregation methods. Most of these support all tasks (Binary classification, Multiclass classification, regression, and survival prediction), but some like the CLAM-models only support binary classification. We are actively working on extending support for these models.
